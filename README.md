This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

SumGameRepo contains the source code of a little game I designed for experimenting with and comparing various web development frameworks. The game has been
build with React, Angular 4, Scala.React and Scala.Angular. This repository contains the code for the React version of the game.

Although the game was designed with no other goal in mind than just experimenting a little bit with web development frameworks, it appears that the game is
interesting in its own right. The game has interesting mathematical properties, and playing it can be fun for anyone who has a feeling for numbers. The game
can be played right away by surfing to the following URL: <work in progress>. Alternatively, one can clone this repository and build and run the game with
npm start.
